{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /home/ac/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-code-plugins/frontend-design/1.0.0/skills/frontend-design\n\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"50e2179a-35fd-4707-bcfd-aa3eb4850fb7","uuid":"2374b3be-3ad2-485f-bc8a-1e3393ea2134","isSynthetic":true}

Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Modificado o CSS para que elementos com `.animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão. A classe `.animate-hidden` também foi ajustada para manter visibilidade. O JavaScript de inicialização de animações foi comentado, garantindo que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `fade-in-up` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Melhorado o Intersection Observer para usar `rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'` e adicionado `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` após animar. Também adicionado um fallback com `setTimeout` de 500ms que verifica se elementos no viewport ainda não têm a classe `visible` e aplica-a automaticamente.

Se não foi criado, executar a story US-015 para criar o site. Se foi criado mas não foi enviado, fazer o deploy. Se o diretório foi removido acidentalmente, restaurá-lo.\n- **Evidências**:\n  - Erro 404 ao acessar https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/laura-bullamah-stoll/index.html\n  - Diretório /site-demo/laura-bullamah-stoll não existe localmente\n  - `ls site-demo/ | grep laura` retorna apenas 'dra-laura-sanches'\n\n### REV-016 - Dr. Ritchelle Henrique\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-016\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Ritchelle Henrique\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-ritchelle-henrique/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: As seções \"Por que escolher a Dra.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.

O texto do título \"Agende sua Consulta\", descrição, informações de endereço, telefone, horário de atendimento e o formulário de contato estão com a cor escura (#0a1628 ou similar) sobre um fundo escuro (rgb(10, 22, 40)), tornando-os invisíveis para o usuário. O conteúdo existe no DOM (60 elementos), mas não é visível devido à falta de contraste de cores.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: O problema real era que os elementos `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tinham `opacity: 0` por padrão e dependiam da classe `animate-in` para ficarem visíveis, mas o JavaScript estava adicionando a classe `visible` (não `animate-in`). Foram feitas as seguintes correções:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão\n  - Alterado o seletor CSS de `.animate-in` para `.visible` para corresponder ao que o JavaScript aplica\n  - Adicionados os seletores `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` à lista de elementos observados pelo Intersection Observer\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis: Hero, Problem/Solution, Services, Testimonials, Differentials, Contact, Footer.

Os cards de problemas (\"Medo e ansiedade do dentista\", \"Tratamentos desconfortáveis\", etc.), soluções (\"Atendimento humanizado e acolhedor\", \"Tecnologia de ponta indolor\", etc.), cards de serviços (\"Estética Dental\", \"Implantes Dentários\", \"Ortodontia\", \"Protetor e Reabilitação\", \"Dentística\", \"Periodontia\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente na carga inicial da página. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem classes CSS (`fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right`, `scale-in`) que definem `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Refatorado o sistema de animações para usar progressive enhancement:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.fade-in`, `.fade-in-left`, `.fade-in-right` e `.scale-in` tenham `opacity: 1` e `transform: none` por padrão\n  - Adicionada classe `.js-enabled` ao body quando JavaScript carrega\n  - Animações agora são aplicadas via classe `.animated` adicionada pelo Intersection Observer\n  - Elementos são sempre visíveis; animações são um bônus quando entram no viewport\n  - Garantido que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página, mesmo sem JavaScript\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Modificado o CSS para que elementos com `.animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão. A classe `.animate-hidden` também foi ajustada para manter visibilidade. O JavaScript de inicialização de animações foi comentado, garantindo que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `fade-in-up` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Melhorado o Intersection Observer para usar `rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'` e adicionado `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` após animar. Também adicionado um fallback com `setTimeout` de 500ms que verifica se elementos no viewport ainda não têm a classe `visible` e aplica-a automaticamente. Adicionada classe `.no-js` como fallback adicional.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px).

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev016-*.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-017 - Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-017\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-017\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-garcia/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~As seções \"O Diferencial Dr. Felipe Garcia\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos Oferecidos\" (services), \"O Que Dizem Nossos Pacientes\" (testimonials), \"Por Que Nos Escolher\" (features) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints.

O card exibia o texto alternativo ou ícone de imagem quebrada em vez da imagem do serviço.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Substituída a URL da imagem quebrada `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599451913777-5f3680cfff21?w=600&q=80` por uma URL válida `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1609840114035-3c981b782dfe?w=600&q=80` no arquivo `site-demo/dr-mauricio-grandini/index.html`.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Os cards de problemas (\"Medo e ansiedade do dentista\", \"Tratamentos desconfortáveis\", etc.), soluções (\"Atendimento humanizado e acolhedor\", \"Tecnologia de ponta indolor\", etc.), cards de serviços (\"Estética Dental\", \"Implantes Dentários\", \"Ortodontia\", \"Protetor e Reabilitação\", \"Dentística\", \"Periodontia\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente na carga inicial da página. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem classes CSS (`fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right`, `scale-in`) que definem `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Refatorado o sistema de animações para usar progressive enhancement:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.fade-in`, `.fade-in-left`, `.fade-in-right` e `.scale-in` tenham `opacity: 1` e `transform: none` por padrão\n  - Adicionada classe `.js-enabled` ao body quando JavaScript carrega\n  - Animações agora são aplicadas via classe `.animated` adicionada pelo Intersection Observer\n  - Elementos são sempre visíveis; animações são um bônus quando entram no viewport\n  - Garantido que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página, mesmo sem JavaScript\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.
