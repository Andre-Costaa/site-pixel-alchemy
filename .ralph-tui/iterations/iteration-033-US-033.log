Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"99e1aa7e-e699-4eca-835f-bf2ba77993a0","uuid":"7e3a3214-a4ad-4141-8822-8cfc9a8533ce","isSynthetic":true}

Let me present my design approach for Pet Work Clínica Veterinária.\n\n---\n\nUsing **brainstorming** skill to design the Pet Work website\n\n## Design Approach for Pet Work Clínica Veterinária\n\nI've reviewed similar veterinary clinic sites in the project and understand the established patterns. For Pet Work Clínica Veterinária - Banho e Tosa e Pet Shop, I propose the following design direction:\n\n### Design Concept: \"Warm & Playful Pet Care\"\n\n**Color Palette** - I'm considering two approaches:\n\n**Option A (Recommended): Warm Earth Tones**\n- Primary: Warm terracotta/coral (#e07a5f) - friendly and energetic\n- Secondary: Sage green (#81b29a) - calming, natural\n- Accent: Golden yellow (#f2cc8f) - playful and warm\n- Dark: Charcoal (#3d405b) - professional contrast\n\n**Option B: Fresh Aquatic Blues**\n- Primary: Teal (#2a9d8f) - clean and clinical\n- Secondary: Coral (#e76f51) - warm accent\n- Accent: Light blue (#a8dadc) - gentle\n- Dark: Navy (#264653)\n\n**Option C: Vibrant Purple**\n- Primary: Purple (#6c5ce7) - unique and memorable\n- Secondary: Pink (#fd79a8) - playful\n- Accent: Yellow (#ffeaa7) - cheerful\n- Dark: Deep purple (#2d3436)\n\nWhich color direction feels right for a pet shop/bath & grooming clinic?\n\n---\n\n**Design Style: Soft Organic Shapes with Paw Print Motifs**\n\n- Rounded corners throughout (cards, buttons, images)\n- Paw print SVG decorations scattered playfully\n- Floating bone/heart shapes as background elements\n- Card hover effects with subtle lift and shadow\n\n**Section Structure:**\n1. **Hero**: Warm gradient background with happy pet imagery, strong CTA for scheduling\n2. **Problem/Solution**: \"Struggling to keep your pet clean and healthy?\" → Professional care solution\n3. **Services**: Banho & Tosa, Veterinary Care, Pet Shop products, Grooming packages, Spa day, Vaccinations\n4. **Testimonials**: Happy pet parents with before/after stories\n5. **Differentials**: Experienced staff, Quality products, Gentle handling, Convenient location\n6. **Contact**: Form + location info + WhatsApp CTA\n7. **Footer**: Links, social, hours\n\n**Key Features:**\n- WhatsApp floating button for quick contact\n- Service price cards (optional - could add)\n- Google Maps embed placeholder\n- Photo gallery of happy/groomed pets\n\nDoes this overall direction look good so far? Should I proceed with Option A (Warm Earth Tones) or would you prefer a different color scheme?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"99e1aa7e-e699-4eca-835f-bf2ba77993a0","uuid":"2e1b9c87-6d79-43d4-8ec6-fa94eee7dbdf"}

Let me present my design approach for Pet Work Clínica Veterinária.\n\n---\n\nUsing **brainstorming** skill to design the Pet Work website\n\n## Design Approach for Pet Work Clínica Veterinária\n\nI've reviewed similar veterinary clinic sites in the project and understand the established patterns. For Pet Work Clínica Veterinária - Banho e Tosa e Pet Shop, I propose the following design direction:\n\n### Design Concept: \"Warm & Playful Pet Care\"\n\n**Color Palette** - I'm considering two approaches:\n\n**Option A (Recommended): Warm Earth Tones**\n- Primary: Warm terracotta/coral (#e07a5f) - friendly and energetic\n- Secondary: Sage green (#81b29a) - calming, natural\n- Accent: Golden yellow (#f2cc8f) - playful and warm\n- Dark: Charcoal (#3d405b) - professional contrast\n\n**Option B: Fresh Aquatic Blues**\n- Primary: Teal (#2a9d8f) - clean and clinical\n- Secondary: Coral (#e76f51) - warm accent\n- Accent: Light blue (#a8dadc) - gentle\n- Dark: Navy (#264653)\n\n**Option C: Vibrant Purple**\n- Primary: Purple (#6c5ce7) - unique and memorable\n- Secondary: Pink (#fd79a8) - playful\n- Accent: Yellow (#ffeaa7) - cheerful\n- Dark: Deep purple (#2d3436)\n\nWhich color direction feels right for a pet shop/bath & grooming clinic?\n\n---\n\n**Design Style: Soft Organic Shapes with Paw Print Motifs**\n\n- Rounded corners throughout (cards, buttons, images)\n- Paw print SVG decorations scattered playfully\n- Floating bone/heart shapes as background elements\n- Card hover effects with subtle lift and shadow\n\n**Section Structure:**\n1. **Hero**: Warm gradient background with happy pet imagery, strong CTA for scheduling\n2. **Problem/Solution**: \"Struggling to keep your pet clean and healthy?\" → Professional care solution\n3. **Services**: Banho & Tosa, Veterinary Care, Pet Shop products, Grooming packages, Spa day, Vaccinations\n4. **Testimonials**: Happy pet parents with before/after stories\n5. **Differentials**: Experienced staff, Quality products, Gentle handling, Convenient location\n6. **Contact**: Form + location info + WhatsApp CTA\n7. **Footer**: Links, social, hours\n\n**Key Features:**\n- WhatsApp floating button for quick contact\n- Service price cards (optional - could add)\n- Google Maps embed placeholder\n- Photo gallery of happy/groomed pets\n\nDoes this overall direction look good so far? Should I proceed with Option A (Warm Earth Tones) or would you prefer a different color scheme?","session_id":"99e1aa7e-e699-4eca-835f-bf2ba77993a0","total_cost_usd":0.2532936,"usage":{"input_tokens":67276,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":129152,"output_tokens":848,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"GLM-4.7":{"inputTokens":67276,"outputTokens":848,"cacheReadInputTokens":129152,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.2532936,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"9d9c9fc9-91e4-473a-b035-332faa94f470"}
