Isso é um comportamento intencional do design - os elementos começam com `opacity: 0` e ganham visibilidade conforme o usuário navega pela página. Após o scroll, todas as seções são exibidas corretamente.\n\n### Notas\n\nSite aprovado para entrega ao cliente. Layout responsivo funcionando corretamente em todos os breakpoints testados (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Formulário de contato validado e funcionando. Navegação por âncoras operacional. Todas as imagens carregando corretamente da Unsplash. Animações de scroll funcionam conforme esperado - elementos ficam visíveis após o usuário fazer scroll pela página.\n\nEvidências disponíveis em:\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev041-1440-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev041-1024-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev041-768-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev041-480-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev041-1440-after-scroll.png`\n\n---\n\n## REV-035 - Centro de Clareamento Dental\n\n**URL Revisado:** https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/centro-clareamento-dental/index.html\n\n**Data da Revisão:** 2026-01-31\n\n**Status:** ❌ REPROVADO\n\n**passes:** false\n\n### Checklist de Validação\n\n#### Layout e Responsividade\n- [ ] 1440px - Desktop large\n- [ ] 1024px - Desktop\n- [ ] 768px - Tablet\n- [ ] 480px - Mobile\n\n#### Imagens e Mídias\n- [x] Todas as imagens carregam corretamente\n- [x] Sem placeholders quebrados\n- [x] Sem imagens faltantes\n\n#### Navegação\n- [x] Âncoras internas funcionam\n- [x] CTAs não abrem páginas externas\n\n#### Formulários e Interações\n- [x] Formulário funciona sem erros\n- [x] Interações visuais ok\n\n#### Console\n- [x] Sem erros críticos de JS\n- [x] Sem recursos bloqueados\n\n### Issues Encontradas\n\n**CRÍTICO:** As seções entre o hero e o footer estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints testados (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px).\n\n**Seções afetadas:**\n- \"Problemas vs Solução\" (cards de problemas: Dentes Amarelados, Sorriso Sem Vida, Tratamentos Ineficazes; cards de solução: Clareamento a laser em 50 minutos, Resultado imediato de até 8 tons, Sem sensibilidade após o tratamento, Durabilidade de 1 a 3 anos, Acompanhamento pós-tratamento)\n- \"Opções de Clareamento\" (Clareamento a Laser, Clareamento Caseiro, Combo Premium)\n- \"Depoimentos\" (Maria Aparecida, Carolina Silva, Roberto Ferreira)\n- \"Diferenciais\" (Tecnologia Certificada, Profissionais Especializados, Rapidez e Conforto, Satisfação Garantida)\n- \"Contato\" (formulário e informações de contato)\n\n**Causa raiz:** Os elementos possuem as classes CSS `fade-up`, `fade-left`, `fade-right` e `scale-in` que definem `opacity: 0` por padrão (linhas 999-1041 do CSS). A classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n\n**Correção sugerida:** Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com classes de animação tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `visible` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `visible` por padrão no HTML.\n\n### Notas\n\nSite reprovado devido à invisibilidade de todas as seções de conteúdo na carga inicial. O problema afeta a experiência do usuário de forma crítica, pois o visitante não consegue ver nenhuma informação sobre os serviços, depoimentos ou formulário de contato sem primeiro fazer scroll por toda a página.\n\nEvidências disponíveis em:\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev035-1440-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev035-1024-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev035-768-full.png`\n- `.playwright-mcp/rev035-480-full.png`\n","numLines":241,"startLine":1,"totalLines":241}}}
