Ana Carolina Orlanda Junqueira Defina\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-005\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-033\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dra. Ana Carolina Orlanda Junqueira Defina\n- **URL do demo**: /site-demo/dra-ana-carolina-orlanda/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: As seções \"A Experiência que Você Merece\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos que Transformam\" (services), \"Depoimentos\", \"Diferenciais\" e \"Contato\" estão com conteúdo invisível (opacity: 0) devido à classe CSS `animate-on-scroll`. Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, adicionar uma classe `animated` por padrão no HTML ou garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/dra-ana-carolina-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco nas seções intermediárias da página.\n\n### REV-008 - Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-008\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-anderson-nunes/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" (problem-solution) está completamente vazia/invisível em todos os breakpoints. Os 6 cards (3 problemas: \"Dentes Amarelados\", \"Dor ao Sorrir\", \"Profissionais Impessoais\" e 3 soluções: \"Sorriso Brilhante\", \"Conforto Total\", \"Atendimento Humanizado\") não estão sendo renderizados visualmente. Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev008-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco na seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" onde deveriam estar os cards de problemas e soluções.\n\n### REV-003 - Dra.

Laura Sanches\" (uma mulher). Isso cria uma inconsistência entre o conteúdo visual e o nome da profissional.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Substituir a imagem do hero por uma foto de uma dentista mulher. Sugestão: usar uma imagem de uma profissional feminina em consultório odontológico.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshot em `.playwright-mcp/dra-laura-sanches-final-1440.png` - notar que a imagem no hero mostra um homem de jaleco branco, não uma mulher.\n\n### REV-011 - Dra.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `fade-in` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial da página.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `fade-in` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `visible` for aplicada.

Os cards de problemas (\"Sente-se inseguro ao sorrir em fotos\", \"Evita situações sociais por vergonha\", \"Sofre com dores dentárias frequentes\", \"Não se sente confiante no trabalho\"), soluções (\"Recupere a autoestima com um sorriso radiante\", \"Tratamentos personalizados para você\", \"Tecnologia avançada e conforto absoluto\", \"Equipe especialista que cuida de você\"), cards de serviços (\"Implantes Dentários\", \"Estética Dental\", \"Clareamento Dental\", \"Ortodontia\", \"Próteses Dentárias\", \"Clínico Geral\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente na carga inicial da página. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `reveal` que define `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(30px)` no CSS (linhas 1348-1351), mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll.
