Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, adicionar uma classe `animated` por padrão no HTML ou garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/dra-ana-carolina-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco nas seções intermediárias da página.\n\n### REV-008 - Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-008\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-anderson-nunes/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" (problem-solution) está completamente vazia/invisível em todos os breakpoints.

O card exibe um placeholder azul escuro em vez da imagem do serviço. A requisição de rede para a imagem `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583947581924-8661fc80873e?w=600&q=80` não retornou status code, indicando possível erro 404 ou problema de carregamento.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Substituir a URL da imagem quebrada no arquivo `site-demo/clinica-livhera/index.html` por uma URL válida do Unsplash. Sugestão: usar uma imagem similar às dos outros cards de serviços odontológicos, como `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606811841689-23dfddce3e95?w=600&q=80` ou outra imagem relacionada a restaurações dentárias.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/clinica-livhera-1440-tratamentos.png` e `.playwright-mcp/clinica-livhera-1024-cards.png` - notar que o card \"Restauração Estética\" exibe um fundo azul escuro em vez da imagem, enquanto os outros cards mostram as imagens corretamente.\n\n### REV-036 - Clínica Doctor Oral\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-036\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Clínica Doctor Oral\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/clinica-doctor-oral/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Entre em Contato\" (contact) está com o conteúdo invisível em todos os breakpoints. O texto do título \"Agende sua Consulta\", descrição, informações de endereço, telefone, horário de atendimento e o formulário de contato estão com a cor escura (#0a1628 ou similar) sobre um fundo escuro (rgb(10, 22, 40)), tornando-os invisíveis para o usuário. O conteúdo existe no DOM (60 elementos), mas não é visível devido à falta de contraste de cores.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS da seção de contato para garantir que todo o texto tenha cor clara (branco ou #f8fafc) sobre o fundo escuro. Especificamente, adicionar estilos para `.contact-title`, `.contact-description`, `.contact-item`, labels do formulário e inputs com cor clara. Exemplo:\n  ```css\n  #contato .contact-title,\n  #contato .contact-description,\n  #contato .contact-item,\n  #contato label {\n    color: #f8fafc;\n  }\n  ```\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev036-doctor-oral-1440-bottom.png` e `.playwright-mcp/rev036-doctor-oral-480-contato.png` - notar que a seção de contato aparece como uma área escura vazia sem texto visível.\n\n### REV-037 - Consultório Odontológico Dr Mauricio Grandini\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-037\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-037\n- **Nome do cliente**: Consultório Odontológico Dr Mauricio Grandini\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-mauricio-grandini/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~A imagem do serviço \"Limpeza e Prevenção\" não estava carregando (404 Not Found) devido a uma URL do Unsplash inválida (`photo-1599451913777-5f3680cfff21`). O card exibia o texto alternativo ou ícone de imagem quebrada em vez da imagem do serviço.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Substituída a URL da imagem quebrada `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599451913777-5f3680cfff21?w=600&q=80` por uma URL válida `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1609840114035-3c981b782dfe?w=600&q=80` no arquivo `site-demo/dr-mauricio-grandini/index.html`.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis e bem formatadas. Navegação e CTAs funcionando. Formulário operacional. Console limpo de erros críticos.\n","numLines":299,"startLine":1,"totalLines":299}}}

Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, adicionar uma classe `animated` por padrão no HTML ou garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/dra-ana-carolina-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco nas seções intermediárias da página.\n\n### REV-008 - Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-008\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-anderson-nunes/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" (problem-solution) está completamente vazia/invisível em todos os breakpoints. Os 6 cards (3 problemas: \"Dentes Amarelados\", \"Dor ao Sorrir\", \"Profissionais Impessoais\" e 3 soluções: \"Sorriso Brilhante\", \"Conforto Total\", \"Atendimento Humanizado\") não estão sendo renderizados visualmente. Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev008-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco na seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" onde deveriam estar os cards de problemas e soluções.\n\n### REV-003 - Dra.

Sugestão: usar uma imagem de uma profissional feminina em consultório odontológico.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshot em `.playwright-mcp/dra-laura-sanches-final-1440.png` - notar que a imagem no hero mostra um homem de jaleco branco, não uma mulher.\n\n### REV-011 - Dra.
