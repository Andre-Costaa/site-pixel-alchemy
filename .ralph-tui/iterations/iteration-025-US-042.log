Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d9c9cb1b-0455-411d-b27e-767a94e3afe0","uuid":"6fd9d244-2433-42c3-98a0-749d22b5b807","isSynthetic":true}

File Organization**\n- **Single-page HTML structure** with embedded CSS and JavaScript\n- Each site in its own folder: `site-demo/[clinic-name]/index.html`\n- Total of 45 veterinary clinic sites created for Ribeirão Preto\n\n### **2. Section Structure Pattern**\nAll veterinary clinics follow this consistent structure:\n```html\n<section class=\"hero\" id=\"inicio\">\n<section class=\"section problem-solution\"> <!-- Some clinics -->\n<section class=\"services\" id=\"servicos\">\n<section class=\"section testimonials\" id=\"depoimentos\">\n<section class=\"section diferenciais\"> <!-- Some clinics -->\n<section class=\"section contact\" id=\"contato\">\n```\n\n### **3. Color System Patterns**\n\n**Veterinary Color Palettes:**\n1. **Nova Aliança**: Teal + Sage + Coral (nature-inspired)\n   - `--color-teal: #2A9D8F`\n   - `--color-sage: #606C38`\n   - `--color-coral: #E76F51`\n\n2. **Feline Specialist**: Warm browns + greens (cat-friendly)\n   - `--color-primary: #D4A574` (warm brown)\n   - `--color-secondary: #7D9B84` (sage)\n   - `--color-accent: #C77B63` (coral)\n\n3. **Dr. Daleck**: Coral + Teal gradients\n   - `--color-primary: #D4765B`\n   - `--gradient-warm: linear-gradient(135deg, #D4765B 0%, #E89B85 50%, #F4A88A 100%)`\n\n4. **Lovets**: Burgundy + Sage + Cream (trustworthy)\n   - `--color-burgundy: #7c2a3a`\n   - `--color-sage: #4a7c59`\n   - `--color-cream: #faf8f3`\n\n### **4. Common Veterinary Services Pattern**\n\nEach clinic includes these 6 core services:\n```html\n<div class=\"service-card\">\n  <div class=\"service-icon\">\n    <svg> ... </svg>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Service Name</h3>\n  <p>Description focusing on care and expertise</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Typical Services:**\n1. Consultas Clínicas (Clinical Examinations)\n2. Cirurgias (Surgeries)\n3. Vacinação (Vaccination)\n4. Exames Laboratoriais (Laboratory Tests)\n5. Emergências 24h (24h Emergency)\n6. Banho & Tosa (Grooming)\n\n### **5. Image Handling**\n\n**Image Sources:**\n- All use Unsplash stock photos with specific parameters\n- Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?w=800&h=1000&fit=crop`\n- Alt text descriptive and SEO-friendly\n- No local images - all CDN-based\n\n### **6. Typography Patterns**\n\n**Font Combinations:**\n- **Most Common**: Bricolage Grotesque + Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **Premium**: Playfair Display + DM Sans\n- **Specialized**: Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans\n\n### **7. Design System Consistency**\n\n**CSS Variables Pattern:**\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Base Colors */\n  --color-charcoal: #2C3E50;\n  --color-cream: #F8F5F2;\n  \n  /* Accent Colors */\n  --color-primary: #XXX;\n  --color-primary-light: #XXX;\n  --color-secondary: #XXX;\n  \n  /* Gradients */\n  --gradient-warm: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-primary) 0%, var(--color-secondary) 100%);\n  \n  /* Spacing */\n  --spacing-xs: 0.5rem;\n  --spacing-sm: 1rem;\n  --spacing-md: 1.5rem;\n  --spacing-lg: 2.5rem;\n  --spacing-xl: 4rem;\n  --spacing-2xl: 6rem;\n  \n  /* Transitions */\n  --transition-fast: 0.2s ease;\n  --transition-base: 0.4s ease;\n  --transition-slow: 0.6s ease;\n}\n```\n\n### **8. Animation System**\n\n**JavaScript Patterns:**\n- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations (`wow-fade-up`)\n- `data-delay` attributes for staggered animations (100ms increments)\n- CSS keyframe animations for continuous effects\n- All respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n### **9. Contact Form Pattern**\n\n**Standard Structure:**\n```html\n<form>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Nome completo\">\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"E-mail\">\n  <select name=\"service\">\n    <option>Selecione um serviço</option>\n    <option>Consulta</option>\n    <option>Emergência</option>\n  </select>\n  <textarea name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Mensagem\"></textarea>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Enviar Mensagem</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### **10. Key Differences for Centro Veterinário Seres**\n\nBased on the PRD, Seres should have:\n- **Location**: Av. Independência, 1810 - Jardim Sumare, Ribeirão Preto - SP, 14010-210\n- **Phone**: (16) 3602-8190\n- **Unique Name**: \"Centro Veterinário Seres\" - suggests comprehensive care\n- **Folder**: `site-demo/centro-veterinario-seres/`\n\n### **11. Unique Positioning Opportunities**\n\nFor Seres, consider:\n- **Color Theme**: Blue/Silver for professionalism + Teal for compassion\n- **Services**: Emphasize comprehensive care (\"Seres\" suggests wholeness)\n- **Hero Message**: Focus on \"cuidado completo\" (complete care)\n- **Differentiator**: Position as a complete veterinary center\n\nThis pattern analysis shows that while maintaining consistency is important, each clinic deserves a unique identity through:\n- Custom color palettes that reflect their brand personality\n- Specific messaging that highlights their unique strengths\n- Tailored service descriptions that speak to their target audience\n- Visual elements that create emotional connections with pet owners"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: adde70d (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d9c9cb1b-0455-411d-b27e-767a94e3afe0","uuid":"6602e9ff-10fe-49bd-8f5c-01fe15e79963","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the codebase to find existing veterinary clinic websites that have been created.

Color System Patterns**\n\n**Veterinary Color Palettes:**\n1. **Nova Aliança**: Teal + Sage + Coral (nature-inspired)\n   - `--color-teal: #2A9D8F`\n   - `--color-sage: #606C38`\n   - `--color-coral: #E76F51`\n\n2. **Feline Specialist**: Warm browns + greens (cat-friendly)\n   - `--color-primary: #D4A574` (warm brown)\n   - `--color-secondary: #7D9B84` (sage)\n   - `--color-accent: #C77B63` (coral)\n\n3. **Dr. Daleck**: Coral + Teal gradients\n   - `--color-primary: #D4765B`\n   - `--gradient-warm: linear-gradient(135deg, #D4765B 0%, #E89B85 50%, #F4A88A 100%)`\n\n4. **Lovets**: Burgundy + Sage + Cream (trustworthy)\n   - `--color-burgundy: #7c2a3a`\n   - `--color-sage: #4a7c59`\n   - `--color-cream: #faf8f3`\n\n### **4. Common Veterinary Services Pattern**\n\nEach clinic includes these 6 core services:\n```html\n<div class=\"service-card\">\n  <div class=\"service-icon\">\n    <svg> ... </svg>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Service Name</h3>\n  <p>Description focusing on care and expertise</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Typical Services:**\n1. Consultas Clínicas (Clinical Examinations)\n2. Cirurgias (Surgeries)\n3. Vacinação (Vaccination)\n4. Exames Laboratoriais (Laboratory Tests)\n5. Emergências 24h (24h Emergency)\n6. Banho & Tosa (Grooming)\n\n### **5. Image Handling**\n\n**Image Sources:**\n- All use Unsplash stock photos with specific parameters\n- Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?w=800&h=1000&fit=crop`\n- Alt text descriptive and SEO-friendly\n- No local images - all CDN-based\n\n### **6. Typography Patterns**\n\n**Font Combinations:**\n- **Most Common**: Bricolage Grotesque + Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **Premium**: Playfair Display + DM Sans\n- **Specialized**: Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans\n\n### **7. Design System Consistency**\n\n**CSS Variables Pattern:**\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Base Colors */\n  --color-charcoal: #2C3E50;\n  --color-cream: #F8F5F2;\n  \n  /* Accent Colors */\n  --color-primary: #XXX;\n  --color-primary-light: #XXX;\n  --color-secondary: #XXX;\n  \n  /* Gradients */\n  --gradient-warm: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-primary) 0%, var(--color-secondary) 100%);\n  \n  /* Spacing */\n  --spacing-xs: 0.5rem;\n  --spacing-sm: 1rem;\n  --spacing-md: 1.5rem;\n  --spacing-lg: 2.5rem;\n  --spacing-xl: 4rem;\n  --spacing-2xl: 6rem;\n  \n  /* Transitions */\n  --transition-fast: 0.2s ease;\n  --transition-base: 0.4s ease;\n  --transition-slow: 0.6s ease;\n}\n```\n\n### **8. Animation System**\n\n**JavaScript Patterns:**\n- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations (`wow-fade-up`)\n- `data-delay` attributes for staggered animations (100ms increments)\n- CSS keyframe animations for continuous effects\n- All respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n### **9. Contact Form Pattern**\n\n**Standard Structure:**\n```html\n<form>\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Nome completo\">\n  <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"E-mail\">\n  <select name=\"service\">\n    <option>Selecione um serviço</option>\n    <option>Consulta</option>\n    <option>Emergência</option>\n  </select>\n  <textarea name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Mensagem\"></textarea>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Enviar Mensagem</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### **10. Key Differences for Centro Veterinário Seres**\n\nBased on the PRD, Seres should have:\n- **Location**: Av. Independência, 1810 - Jardim Sumare, Ribeirão Preto - SP, 14010-210\n- **Phone**: (16) 3602-8190\n- **Unique Name**: \"Centro Veterinário Seres\" - suggests comprehensive care\n- **Folder**: `site-demo/centro-veterinario-seres/`\n\n### **11. Unique Positioning Opportunities**\n\nFor Seres, consider:\n- **Color Theme**: Blue/Silver for professionalism + Teal for compassion\n- **Services**: Emphasize comprehensive care (\"Seres\" suggests wholeness)\n- **Hero Message**: Focus on \"cuidado completo\" (complete care)\n- **Differentiator**: Position as a complete veterinary center\n\nThis pattern analysis shows that while maintaining consistency is important, each clinic deserves a unique identity through:\n- Custom color palettes that reflect their brand personality\n- Specific messaging that highlights their unique strengths\n- Tailored service descriptions that speak to their target audience\n- Visual elements that create emotional connections with pet owners"}],"totalDurationMs":154142,"totalTokens":0,"totalToolUseCount":25,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}}}
