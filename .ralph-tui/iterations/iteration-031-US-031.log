Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"59c0ddc5-016f-456a-86f1-72a6a86f453e","uuid":"70246bf0-2dfe-404a-bd47-249a001f0552","isSynthetic":true}
