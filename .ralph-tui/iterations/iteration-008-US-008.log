Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem classes CSS (`fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right`, `scale-in`) que definem `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll.

Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Modificado o CSS para que elementos com `.animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão. A classe `.animate-hidden` também foi ajustada para manter visibilidade. O JavaScript de inicialização de animações foi comentado, garantindo que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `fade-in-up` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Melhorado o Intersection Observer para usar `rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'` e adicionado `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` após animar. Também adicionado um fallback com `setTimeout` de 500ms que verifica se elementos no viewport ainda não têm a classe `visible` e aplica-a automaticamente.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.

Ana Carolina Orlanda Junqueira Defina\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dra-ana-carolina-orlanda/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~As seções \"A Experiência que Você Merece\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos que Transformam\" (services), \"Depoimentos\", \"Diferenciais\" e \"Contato\" estão com conteúdo invisível (opacity: 0) devido à classe CSS `animate-on-scroll`. Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Modificado o CSS para que elementos com `.animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão. A classe `.animate-hidden` também foi ajustada para manter visibilidade. O JavaScript de inicialização de animações foi comentado, garantindo que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis: Hero, Problem/Solution, Services, Testimonials, Differentials, Contact, Footer.

Os 6 cards (3 problemas: \"Dentes Amarelados\", \"Dor ao Sorrir\", \"Profissionais Impessoais\" e 3 soluções: \"Sorriso Brilhante\", \"Conforto Total\", \"Atendimento Humanizado\") não estão sendo renderizados visualmente. Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `fade-in-up` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Melhorado o Intersection Observer para usar `rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'` e adicionado `observer.unobserve(entry.target)` após animar. Também adicionado um fallback com `setTimeout` de 500ms que verifica se elementos no viewport ainda não têm a classe `visible` e aplica-a automaticamente. Adicionada classe `.no-js` como fallback adicional.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis: Hero, Problem/Solution, Services, Testimonials, Differentials, Contact, Footer. Navegação e CTAs funcionando. Formulário operacional com máscara de telefone.

O script roda múltiplas vezes (imediatamente, no DOMContentLoaded, no load do window, e após timeouts de 50ms, 100ms e 500ms) para garantir que todos os elementos sejam visíveis independentemente do momento de renderização.

A story US-015 está marcada como \"passes\": true e \"completionNotes\": \"Completed by agent\" no prd.json, mas o diretório 'site-demo/laura-bullamah-stoll' não foi encontrado localmente e o URL de produção retorna erro 404 (NOT_FOUND). Não é possível realizar a revisão Playwright sem o site estar disponível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Verificar se o site foi realmente criado e enviado para produção. Se não foi criado, executar a story US-015 para criar o site. Se foi criado mas não foi enviado, fazer o deploy. Se o diretório foi removido acidentalmente, restaurá-lo.\n- **Evidências**:\n  - Erro 404 ao acessar https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/laura-bullamah-stoll/index.html\n  - Diretório /site-demo/laura-bullamah-stoll não existe localmente\n  - `ls site-demo/ | grep laura` retorna apenas 'dra-laura-sanches'\n\n### REV-016 - Dr. Ritchelle Henrique\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-016\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Ritchelle Henrique\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-ritchelle-henrique/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: As seções \"Por que escolher a Dra.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev016-*.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-017 - Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-017\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-017\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-garcia/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~As seções \"O Diferencial Dr. Felipe Garcia\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos Oferecidos\" (services), \"O Que Dizem Nossos Pacientes\" (testimonials), \"Por Que Nos Escolher\" (features) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints.

O texto do título \"Agende sua Consulta\", descrição, informações de endereço, telefone, horário de atendimento e o formulário de contato estão com a cor escura (#0a1628 ou similar) sobre um fundo escuro (rgb(10, 22, 40)), tornando-os invisíveis para o usuário. O conteúdo existe no DOM (60 elementos), mas não é visível devido à falta de contraste de cores.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: O problema real era que os elementos `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tinham `opacity: 0` por padrão e dependiam da classe `animate-in` para ficarem visíveis, mas o JavaScript estava adicionando a classe `visible` (não `animate-in`). Foram feitas as seguintes correções:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão\n  - Alterado o seletor CSS de `.animate-in` para `.visible` para corresponder ao que o JavaScript aplica\n  - Adicionados os seletores `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` à lista de elementos observados pelo Intersection Observer\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem classes CSS (`fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right`, `scale-in`) que definem `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS, mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Refatorado o sistema de animações para usar progressive enhancement:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.fade-in`, `.fade-in-left`, `.fade-in-right` e `.scale-in` tenham `opacity: 1` e `transform: none` por padrão\n  - Adicionada classe `.js-enabled` ao body quando JavaScript carrega\n  - Animações agora são aplicadas via classe `.animated` adicionada pelo Intersection Observer\n  - Elementos são sempre visíveis; animações são um bônus quando entram no viewport\n  - Garantido que todo o conteúdo seja visível imediatamente ao carregar a página, mesmo sem JavaScript\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.
