Katia\" (features) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints. Os cards de problemas (\"Perda de contorno facial\", \"Rugas e linhas de expressão\", etc.), soluções (\"Contorno facial definido\", \"Pele mais lisa\", etc.), cards de serviços (\"Preenchimento Facial\", \"Toxina Botulínica\", \"Harmonização Labial\", \"Bioestimuladores\", \"Fios de PDO\", \"Protocolos Personalizados\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial da página.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada.

Os elementos só ficam visíveis quando a classe `animated` é adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer, mas isso não está acontecendo corretamente na carga inicial da página. Isso resulta em áreas em branco onde deveria haver conteúdo.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, adicionar uma classe `animated` por padrão no HTML ou garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/dra-ana-carolina-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco nas seções intermediárias da página.\n\n### REV-008 - Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-008\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Anderson Sousa Nunes\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-anderson-nunes/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" (problem-solution) está completamente vazia/invisível em todos os breakpoints. Os 6 cards (3 problemas: \"Dentes Amarelados\", \"Dor ao Sorrir\", \"Profissionais Impessoais\" e 3 soluções: \"Sorriso Brilhante\", \"Conforto Total\", \"Atendimento Humanizado\") não estão sendo renderizados visualmente. Apenas o texto \"VS\" aparece no centro da seção. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer não está sendo aplicada corretamente na carga inicial.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev008-*.png` - notar as áreas em branco na seção \"Por que escolher o Dr. Felipe?\" onde deveriam estar os cards de problemas e soluções.\n\n### REV-003 - Dra.
