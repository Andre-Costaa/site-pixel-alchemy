O script roda múltiplas vezes (imediatamente, no DOMContentLoaded, no load do window, e após timeouts de 50ms, 100ms e 500ms) para garantir que todos os elementos sejam visíveis independentemente do momento de renderização.

Se não foi criado, executar a story US-015 para criar o site. Se foi criado mas não foi enviado, fazer o deploy.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev016-*.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-017 - Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-017\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-017\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-garcia/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~As seções \"O Diferencial Dr. Felipe Garcia\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos Oferecidos\" (services), \"O Que Dizem Nossos Pacientes\" (testimonials), \"Por Que Nos Escolher\" (features) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints.
