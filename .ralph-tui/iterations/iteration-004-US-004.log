Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML.

O conteúdo existe no DOM (60 elementos), mas não é visível devido à falta de contraste de cores.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: O problema real era que os elementos `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tinham `opacity: 0` por padrão e dependiam da classe `animate-in` para ficarem visíveis, mas o JavaScript estava adicionando a classe `visible` (não `animate-in`). Foram feitas as seguintes correções:\n  - Modificado o CSS para que `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão\n  - Alterado o seletor CSS de `.animate-in` para `.visible` para corresponder ao que o JavaScript aplica\n  - Adicionados os seletores `.contact-info` e `.contact-form-wrapper` à lista de elementos observados pelo Intersection Observer\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção.
