Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `animate-on-scroll` que define `opacity: 0`, mas a classe `animated` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Em uma carga inicial, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `animate-on-scroll` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `animated` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `animated` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev016-*.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-017 - Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-017\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-017\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dr. Felipe Garcia\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-felipe-garcia/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~As seções \"O Diferencial Dr. Felipe Garcia\" (problem-solution), \"Tratamentos Oferecidos\" (services), \"O Que Dizem Nossos Pacientes\" (testimonials), \"Por Que Nos Escolher\" (features) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints.

Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `reveal` que define `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS (linhas 1157-1161), mas a classe `active` que deveria ser adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Modificado o CSS para garantir visibilidade por padrão:\n  - Alterado `.reveal` para ter `opacity: 1` e `transform: translateY(0)` por padrão\n  - Adicionada classe `.animate` para controlar animações opcionais\n  - JavaScript atualizado para garantir que elementos sejam visíveis imediatamente\n  - Mantida compatibilidade com Intersection Observer para animações de scroll\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis: Hero, Problem/Solution, Services, Testimonials, Differentials, Contact, Footer. Navegação e CTAs funcionando. Formulário operacional com máscara de telefone. Console limpo de erros críticos.\n\n### REV-029 - VIVA SORRINDO\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-029\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: VIVA SORRINDO\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/viva-sorrindo/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: As seções \"Dificuldades vs Solução\" (problem-solution), \"Nossos Serviços\" (services), \"O Que Nossos Pacientes Dizem\" (testimonials), \"Por Que Escolher a VIVA SORRINDO?\" (differentials) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints. Os cards de problemas (\"Sente-se inseguro ao sorrir em fotos\", \"Evita situações sociais por vergonha\", \"Sofre com dores dentárias frequentes\", \"Não se sente confiante no trabalho\"), soluções (\"Recupere a autoestima com um sorriso radiante\", \"Tratamentos personalizados para você\", \"Tecnologia avançada e conforto absoluto\", \"Equipe especialista que cuida de você\"), cards de serviços (\"Implantes Dentários\", \"Estética Dental\", \"Clareamento Dental\", \"Ortodontia\", \"Próteses Dentárias\", \"Clínico Geral\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente na carga inicial da página. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem a classe `reveal` que define `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(30px)` no CSS (linhas 1348-1351), mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via JavaScript/Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `reveal` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `visible` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `visible` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev029-viva-sorrindo-1440-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev029-viva-sorrindo-1024-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev029-viva-sorrindo-768-full.png` e `.playwright-mcp/rev029-viva-sorrindo-480-full.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-028 - Dra Isabô Tortoriello\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-028\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-028\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dra Isabô Tortoriello\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dra-isabo-tortoriello/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: N/A\n- **Problema**: O site não existe. A story US-028 está marcada como \"passes\": true e \"completionNotes\": \"Completed by agent\" no prd.json, mas o diretório 'site-demo/dra-isabo-tortoriello' não foi encontrado localmente e o URL de produção retorna erro 404 (NOT_FOUND). Não é possível realizar a revisão Playwright sem o site estar disponível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Verificar se o site foi realmente criado e enviado para produção. Se não foi criado, executar a story US-028 para criar o site. Se foi criado mas não foi enviado, fazer o deploy. Se o diretório foi removido acidentalmente, restaurá-lo.\n- **Evidências**:\n  - Erro 404 ao acessar https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dra-isabo-tortoriello/index.html\n  - Diretório /site-demo/dra-isabo-tortoriello não existe localmente\n  - `ls site-demo/ | grep isabo` não retorna resultados\n\n### REV-030 - SORRIA MAIS CLINICA ODONTOLOGICA\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-030\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-030\n- **Nome do cliente**: SORRIA MAIS CLINICA ODONTOLOGICA\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/sorria-mais-clinica/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: N/A\n- **Problema**: O site não existe. A story US-030 está marcada como \"passes\": true no prd2.json, mas o diretório 'site-demo/sorria-mais-clinica' não foi encontrado localmente e o URL de produção retorna erro 404 (NOT_FOUND). Não é possível realizar a revisão Playwright sem o site estar disponível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Verificar se o site foi realmente criado e enviado para produção. Se não foi criado, executar a story US-030 para criar o site. Se foi criado mas não foi enviado, fazer o deploy. Se o diretório foi removido acidentalmente, restaurá-lo.\n- **Evidências**:\n  - Erro 404 ao acessar https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/sorria-mais-clinica/index.html\n  - Diretório /site-demo/sorria-mais-clinica não existe localmente\n  - `ls site-demo/ | grep sorria` retorna apenas 'sorridi-odontologia'\n\n### REV-031 - Clínica Livhera\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-031\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-031\n- **Nome do cliente**: Clínica Livhera\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/clinica-livhera/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A imagem do serviço \"Restauração Estética\" não está carregando corretamente. O card exibe um placeholder azul escuro em vez da imagem do serviço. A requisição de rede para a imagem `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583947581924-8661fc80873e?w=600&q=80` não retornou status code, indicando possível erro 404 ou problema de carregamento.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Substituir a URL da imagem quebrada no arquivo `site-demo/clinica-livhera/index.html` por uma URL válida do Unsplash. Sugestão: usar uma imagem similar às dos outros cards de serviços odontológicos, como `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606811841689-23dfddce3e95?w=600&q=80` ou outra imagem relacionada a restaurações dentárias.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/clinica-livhera-1440-tratamentos.png` e `.playwright-mcp/clinica-livhera-1024-cards.png` - notar que o card \"Restauração Estética\" exibe um fundo azul escuro em vez da imagem, enquanto os outros cards mostram as imagens corretamente.\n\n### REV-036 - Clínica Doctor Oral\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-036\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Clínica Doctor Oral\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/clinica-doctor-oral/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: A seção \"Entre em Contato\" (contact) está com o conteúdo invisível em todos os breakpoints. O texto do título \"Agende sua Consulta\", descrição, informações de endereço, telefone, horário de atendimento e o formulário de contato estão com a cor escura (#0a1628 ou similar) sobre um fundo escuro (rgb(10, 22, 40)), tornando-os invisíveis para o usuário. O conteúdo existe no DOM (60 elementos), mas não é visível devido à falta de contraste de cores.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS da seção de contato para garantir que todo o texto tenha cor clara (branco ou #f8fafc) sobre o fundo escuro. Especificamente, adicionar estilos para `.contact-title`, `.contact-description`, `.contact-item`, labels do formulário e inputs com cor clara. Exemplo:\n  ```css\n  #contato .contact-title,\n  #contato .contact-description,\n  #contato .contact-item,\n  #contato label {\n    color: #f8fafc;\n  }\n  ```\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev036-doctor-oral-1440-bottom.png` e `.playwright-mcp/rev036-doctor-oral-480-contato.png` - notar que a seção de contato aparece como uma área escura vazia sem texto visível.\n\n### REV-037 - Consultório Odontológico Dr Mauricio Grandini\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-037\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-037\n- **Nome do cliente**: Consultório Odontológico Dr Mauricio Grandini\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dr-mauricio-grandini/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: ~~A imagem do serviço \"Limpeza e Prevenção\" não estava carregando (404 Not Found) devido a uma URL do Unsplash inválida (`photo-1599451913777-5f3680cfff21`). O card exibia o texto alternativo ou ícone de imagem quebrada em vez da imagem do serviço.~~ ✅ **CORRIGIDO**\n- **Correção aplicada**: Substituída a URL da imagem quebrada `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599451913777-5f3680cfff21?w=600&q=80` por uma URL válida `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1609840114035-3c981b782dfe?w=600&q=80` no arquivo `site-demo/dr-mauricio-grandini/index.html`.\n- **Status**: ✅ Aprovado após correção. Layout validado em todos os breakpoints (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px). Todas as seções visíveis e bem formatadas. Navegação e CTAs funcionando. Formulário operacional. Console limpo de erros críticos.\n\n### REV-043 - Bocardo Odontologia\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-043\n- **ID do PRD original**: N/A (Site Pixel Alchemy - template base)\n- **Nome do cliente**: Bocardo Odontologia\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/bocardo-odontologia/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: Todos (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)\n- **Problema**: As seções \"Por que escolher a Bocardo?\" (problem-solution), \"Nossos Serviços\" (services), \"Depoimentos\" (testimonials), \"Nossos Diferenciais\" (differentiators) e \"Agende Sua Consulta\" (contact) estão completamente vazias/invisíveis em todos os breakpoints. Os cards de problemas (\"Medo e ansiedade do dentista\", \"Tratamentos desconfortáveis\", etc.), soluções (\"Atendimento humanizado e acolhedor\", \"Tecnologia de ponta indolor\", etc.), cards de serviços (\"Estética Dental\", \"Implantes Dentários\", \"Ortodontia\", \"Protetor e Reabilitação\", \"Dentística\", \"Periodontia\"), depoimentos, diferenciais e formulário de contato não estão sendo renderizados visualmente na carga inicial da página. Isso ocorre porque os elementos possuem classes CSS (`fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right`, `scale-in`) que definem `opacity: 0` e `transform: translateY(40px)` no CSS (linhas 1214-1256), mas a classe `visible` que deveria ser adicionada via Intersection Observer só é aplicada quando os elementos entram na viewport durante o scroll. Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right` e `scale-in` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `visible` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `visible` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-1440-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-1024-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-768-full.png` e `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-480-full.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-038 - Dra Letícia Araújo\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-038\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-038\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dra Letícia Araújo\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dra-leticia-araujo/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: N/A\n- **Problema**: O site não existe.

A story US-038 (story original de criação do site) não existe no prd2.json, indicando que o site nunca foi criado. Não é possível realizar a revisão Playwright sem o site estar disponível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Verificar se a story US-038 existe e foi executada. Se não existir, criar a story US-038 no prd2.json e executá-la para criar o site. Se a story existir mas não foi executada, executá-la para gerar o site.

Na carga inicial da página, todo o conteúdo abaixo da dobra fica invisível.\n- **Correção sugerida**: Modificar o CSS para que os elementos com `fade-in`, `fade-in-left`, `fade-in-right` e `scale-in` tenham `opacity: 1` por padrão e apenas adicionem a animação quando a classe `visible` for aplicada. Alternativamente, garantir que o Intersection Observer dispare imediatamente para elementos visíveis ou adicionar a classe `visible` por padrão no HTML. Outra opção é usar uma media query `prefers-reduced-motion` ou adicionar uma classe de fallback.\n- **Evidências**: Screenshots em `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-1440-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-1024-full.png`, `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-768-full.png` e `.playwright-mcp/rev043-bocardo-480-full.png` - notar as grandes áreas em branco entre o hero e o footer onde deveriam estar todas as seções de conteúdo.\n\n### REV-038 - Dra Letícia Araújo\n- **ID da revisão**: REV-038\n- **ID do PRD original**: US-038\n- **Nome do cliente**: Dra Letícia Araújo\n- **URL do demo**: https://pixelalchemy.com.br/site-demo/dra-leticia-araujo/index.html\n- **Breakpoint(s) afetado(s)**: N/A\n- **Problema**: O site não existe.
