# Pixel Alchemy - Progress Tracking

## Codebase Patterns

### Site Structure Pattern
- Self-contained single-file HTML sites in `site-demo/<slug>/index.html`
- Inline CSS and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Standard sections: Hero, Problema/Solução, Serviços, Depoimentos, Diferenciais, Contato, Footer

### Design System
- CSS custom properties for colors (--color-*, --pearl-*, --mint-*)
- Blobmorphism with CSS blur and backdrop-filter
- Animation system: CSS keyframes + Intersection Observer
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints: 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

  - Created `.playwright-mcp/dra-mariana-alves-silva-1024.png`
  - Created `.playwright-mcp/dra-mariana-alves-silva-768.png`
  - Created `.playwright-mcp/dra-mariana-alves-silva-480.png`
- **Learnings:**
  - All mandatory sections validated and present (Hero, Problema/Solução, Serviços, Depoimentos, Diferenciais, Contato, Footer)
  - Problema/Solução section is properly implemented as dedicated section (not replaced by generic Sobre)
  - Site is responsive at all breakpoints
  - Only console error is favicon 404 (non-critical)
  - Done gate shows `notion.no_manual_fallback` as historical artifact from original US-090 creation - does not affect site functionality
